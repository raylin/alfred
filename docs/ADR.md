## ADR-001 — Use type predicate for LINE message content narrowing

- **Date:** 2026-05-04
- **Status:** accepted
- **Task:** Task 2

### Context
LINE webhook message events carry a `message` field that is either a text message or another type (image, sticker, etc.). TypeScript's discriminated union narrowing breaks when one union member uses `type: string` (the catch-all), because `string` is a supertype of any literal — so `message.type === 'text'` can't exclude the catch-all member. The result: `message.text` is inaccessible even inside the narrowed branch.

### Decision
Export a `isTextMessage(msg): msg is LineTextMessageContent` type predicate from `src/integrations/line.ts`. Callers use this predicate instead of inline `=== 'text'` checks.

### Alternatives considered
- Remove the catch-all type and only list known message types — would break silently when LINE adds new message types.
- Use `as` type assertion — suppresses the error but bypasses type safety.
- Use `in` operator narrowing (`'text' in message`) — would work, but predicate is more explicit and reusable.

### Consequences
- Type-safe access to `message.text` without casts.
- Callers must import `isTextMessage`; slightly more verbose than an inline check.
- Future message types (image, location) handled by adding additional predicates as needed.
